# 📊 Bank Marketing Prediction using Decision Tree

This project is part of my internship at **Skillcraft Technology** as a **Data Science Intern** – **Task 3**. The aim is to analyze the **Bank Marketing Dataset** and build a **Decision Tree Classifier** that predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.
